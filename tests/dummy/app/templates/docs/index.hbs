      <h3 class="text-3xl py-4">Usage as a service</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of using the standard Google place autocomplete component, which delegates to google the responsibility
        of adding the UI elements to interact with place predictions. It is possible to use a Google service that you
        can call to get the information in JSON format. The service provides more flexibility when communicating with
        Google Places API. One advantage of usin the service is the possibility to use <strong><i>sessionTokens</i></strong>
        in order to reduce the cost of paid services when getting places information.
